# Q1. values-
#     1.'hello'
#     2. -87.8
#     3. 6
#     expression-
#     1. *
#     2. -
#     3. /
#     4. +
# 
# Q2. variable -1) Variable is a local or global instance where you can store data. It is a kind of means to store a value in a                    memory  location and change it if needed.
#               2)eg. a=10
#               3) You can store string inside a variable.
#     String - 1) String is always enclosed inside "--" or '--'(double quote or single quote). They are sequence of characters.
#              2) eg. s= "chelsea"
#              3) You cannot store variable inside a string.
# 
# Q3. Different types of data types are:
#     1) numeric
#     2) set
#     3) boolean
#     4) dictionary
# 
# Q4. An expression is a combination of values and mathematical operators and they always evaluate them to a single value.
#     eg. >>> 5*3
#         >>> 15
# 
# Q5. Statement- 1)Statements represents actions or commands. 
#                2)eg. assignment statements like spam=10,
#                  print statements like 
#                  >>> print("hello world") 
#     Expression-1) An expression is a combination of values or operators and they always evaluate them to a single value.
#                2) eg. >>> 7+5
#                       >>> 12
# 
# Q6. bacon = 23
# 
# Q7. 'spamspamspam'
# 
# Q8. Variable name should always start with alphabets or underscore(_) . Variable name only includes alphabets and no special         charachter other than underscore(_) is allowed in variable name. That is why eggs is a valid variable name as it follows         the above conditions and 100 is invalid variable name as conditions are not satisfied.
# 
# Q9. the three functions are:
#     1)int 
#     2)flaot
#     3)str
#     
# Q10. 'I have eaten' + 99 + ' burritos.' this expression cause an error because 99 is not written in single quote while other two       are written in single . we can fix this error by putting 99 in single quote('99')
